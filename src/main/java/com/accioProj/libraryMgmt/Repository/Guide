we dont need to  write anything  reposity we just need  to extend  JPArepository which provides inbuilt
methods for save,update,detete,create, search basic operation if we have to run just simple
queriies on database.... JPAreposity is a innterface here we dont need to provide implementation  for it
or even we dont  care about what is that implementation it is internal part of JPA dependency
we just extending it and using there method... but we need create interface which will extends  JPA interface
for each table or we can say entity we have to create diff repo,service and controlller
is will also simplify our task...
