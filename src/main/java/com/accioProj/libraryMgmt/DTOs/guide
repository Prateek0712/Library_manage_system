DTO are user define classes it provide security for  request and responce so client will not be  able  to
 add information which he is not been givne  a permission.
 like if client is  directly able to give  obj  of student  entity then he might be also give  id so that will be
 vulanable becoz id is auto  generated. so it is big  security risk. so what  will we doing we create  class which have
 data type which we want  thatt client should send so ....we will transfer  this DTO  class obj to service where
 we build our student or any  class obj and then pass to  service layer so it  will also provide
 security to great  extent.
